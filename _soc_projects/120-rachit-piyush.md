Description:

We will be using Flutter Framework to compose user interfaces and implement functionality.
Flutter is an extremely trending framework for app development that gives you a rich set of pre-built and pre-styled wireframing widgets. It uses web technologies which are easy to understand. Alibaba recently made their app in Flutter. If it’s good enough for a 25-billion dollar company, it’s worth learning.

Preferred Skills: Some small amount of Coding knowledge would be beneficial along with a working computer onto which you can install Flutter.
